# jax_metric_CalabiYau
 
Some python code written in JAX for finding Ricci-flat metrics on Calabi-Yau manifolds.

This was written mostly for my own amusement, as I wanted something in a functional programming paradigm that also maximised clarity, over speed, for a practicioner who is less comfortable woth computation. For research purposes I suggest useing either https://github.com/pythoncymetric/cymetric or https://github.com/Justin-Tan/cymyc which are both more generic, and have significatly faster point generation (mostly due to my wish to maximise clarity).

# jax_metric_CalabiYau
 
Some python code written in JAX for finding Ricci-flat metrics on Calabi-Yau manifolds.

This was written mostly for my own amusement. For research purposes I suggest useing either https://github.com/pythoncymetric/cymetric or https://github.com/Justin-Tan/cymyc which are both more geneneric, and have significatly faster point generation.
